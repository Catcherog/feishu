## 1. Bootstrap

At the beginning of every new Trae session, run:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only origin master
git status --short
git rev-parse HEAD
```

If the working tree is not clean, do not reset or delete changes. Report the differences and stop.

Then read these files in order:

1. `PUBLIC_EXECUTION_ENTRYPOINT.md`
2. `config/public-execution-manifest.json`
3. `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
4. `DECISION_LOG.md`
5. `docs/audit/PUBLIC_AUDIT_POLICY.md`
6. `docs/audit/phase1b3-independent-audit.md`
7. `docs/audit/phase1b3-remediation-plan.md`
8. `.trae/rules/_public_repo_execution.md`
9. `.trae/rules/_gpt_audit.md`

Do not use remembered instructions from a previous Trae conversation when they conflict with the current repository files.

## 2. Source-of-truth order

When information conflicts, use this priority:

1. Current real Feishu structure and local private configuration
2. Tested code at the current Git commit
3. `config/public-execution-manifest.json`
4. Approved entries in `DECISION_LOG.md`
5. `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
6. Latest acceptance and audit reports
7. Historical README files, old prompts, old screenshots and chat memory

No public file may contain real Base identifiers, table identifiers, field identifiers, record identifiers, credentials, customer data or raw backups.

## 3. Current gate decision

The latest gate decisions are:

```text
GATE_R1 = INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS
GATE_R2 = INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS
GATE_R3 = INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS
GATE_R4 = INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS (MVP_PASS_WITH_DEBT, 2026-07-18)
GATE_R5 = INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS (MVP_PASS_WITH_DEBT, 2026-07-18; P1 scanner debt closed in R6 batch)
GATE_R6 = REVIEW_PENDING (R6 read-only Dry Run completed 2026-07-18; awaiting GPT independent review)
MIGRATION_PILOT_001 = NOT_APPROVED
```

R1 was independently verified on 2026-07-17 (see `docs/audit/phaseR1-independent-verification-2026-07-17.md` and `reports/phaseR1-final-gpt-audit-package.md`). The public tree (113 files) and reachable history (20 commits) both scan as `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`. The 17 pre-rewrite commits are unreachable; their content is preserved only in the local private mirror backup.

R2 technical work is complete (Plan B, user-approved on 2026-07-17). The deterministic Schema v1.0 → v1.1 machine diff (`schemas/schema-diff-v1.0-to-v1.1.json`) and the reproducible generator (`scripts/generate_schema_diff.py`) are committed with three passing tests. The final machine facts are `added_fields=35, removed_fields=0, changed_fields=0, enum_changes=1, required_changes=0, view_changes=4, state_machine_changes=2, global_enum_changes=1`.

R2 resolved the previously detected `SCHEMA_VIEW_DRIFT` by applying Plan B (user-approved):

- Added the four new views from `docs/v2-view-inventory.md` to `schemas/v2-schema-v1.1.json` (Customer 迁移记录, Project 迁移记录, Project 按付款状态分组, Resource 迁移记录). Customer now has 10 views, Project 12 views, Resource 13 views — counts match the inventory.
- Regenerated `schemas/v2-schema-v1.1.sha256` under the LF-normalized SHA256 caliber (matching v1.0). Earlier "v1.0 sha256 drift" reports were a false positive caused by mixing `Get-FileHash` raw bytes with LF-normalized file content; v1.0.sha256 was already correct.
- Regenerated `schemas/schema-diff-v1.0-to-v1.1.json` with `view_changes=4`; SHA256 stable across two consecutive runs (`791b501eed5b2368e13cbc62f0a3dfe5c97cf0a682ebf4f1ecd36d0fe3ef8d69`).
- Updated `tests/test_generate_schema_diff.py` so `test_public_v1_0_to_v1_1_machine_facts` locks in `view_changes=4`. Future silent drift will fail the test.
- Added `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` to `.gitignore` so Python bytecode caches do not pollute the public repo.
- Rewrote `reports/phaseR2-schema-evidence-gpt-audit-package.md` (v2) to reflect the new machine facts and Plan B execution.

A separate conflict remains open for R6 (out of scope for R2): `reports/phase1b3-gpt-audit-package.md` line 132 states "新增 19 个字段", which is inconsistent with the machine fact `added_fields=35`. This is a stale human count in a superseded audit package and will be reconciled when R6 produces a new audit package; it is not a blocker for R2.

R2 did not modify Schema v1.0, any real Feishu Base, the APP, or production automations. The next authorized gate is R3, but R3 must not start until an independent reviewer (GPT or human) reviews the R2 audit package and explicitly approves continuation. Trae must not auto-continue to R3.

## 3.1 R2 independent review outcome (2026-07-17)

R2 has been independently reviewed by GPT (see `reports/phaseR2-independent-gpt-review.md`). The Schema technical implementation was independently verified as PASS. The reviewer initially flagged a P0 on audit-package metadata (placeholder text, stale file count 113 vs 121, missing staged scan result, and acceptance criterion 10 marked "in progress"). All P0 items were subsequently remediated in the audit package at commit `03705691b0b725f005ce6c677ef2989288b60aac`: placeholders backfilled with real commit/blob/SHA256 evidence, file count corrected to the post-R2-v2 total, staged scan result attached, and acceptance criterion 10 marked satisfied.

Based on the independent review outcome and the P0 remediation, all 10 acceptance criteria of TASK-001 are satisfied. Manifest `gate_status.R2` and `audit_status` are advanced to `INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS` and `R2_INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS` respectively. `migration_pilot_status` remains `NOT_APPROVED`.

R3 remains `NOT_STARTED`. Per user instruction, R3 must not auto-start; it will be established and executed only after explicit user approval.

## 3.2 R3+R4 independent review outcome (2026-07-18)

R3+R4 has been independently reviewed by GPT. The full review conclusion and R5 execution constraints are written to `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-003-R5-V11-FIELD-VALIDATION-PACKET.md`. Review outcome: `MVP_PASS_WITH_DEBT`.

Independent evidence verified by GPT:

- `feishu-v2/` working tree clean on `master`; `HEAD == origin/master == 82365a0436aff554e8f7bd5318518caeab993208`.
- R3+R4 P0/P1 fix commits: `402cb6e9dc96c98a7a2d3037bf7035fa532aa8a6` (main fix) and `82365a0...` (SHA backfill).
- `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js`: 58/58 pass, 13 suites, exit 0.
- `scripts/verify_public_repo.py` against tracked 134 files: `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- R4 classification accounting CLI ran twice on 304 private V1 records; all four entity buckets and overall totals reconcile exactly.
- Private matrix SHA256 stable across two runs: `9401ba56f0d812e3f41e47a5450b0bbcf4f2aa25502cf15959e8bdfbb96200f2`.
- Public summary SHA256 stable across two runs: `548077756b9e50b883e2674c2268926849d67e86b13494b90b06673e2c49e632`.
- 3 private paths are gitignored and untracked.

All 5 P0 blockers from `TASK-002-R4-FIX-PACKET.md` are closed:

- P0-1: `budget.js` D-025 prefix-symbol direction (e.g., `<3000` parsed, `3000<` ambiguous).
- P0-2: `classifier.js` D-020 customer status inference propagates any unclear project status.
- P0-3: `PROJECT_STATUS_DIRECT_MAP` added `已交付` / `已归档`.
- P0-4: `customerMissingIdentity` added `has_valid_need_summary` identity path.
- P0-5: Joint R3+R4 audit package rewritten to satisfy AC17/AC19.

P1 doc debt (non-blocking, deferred to R5 Task 1): `reports/classifier-test-report.md` Section 2 suite counts were mis-aligned with the TAP output. Fixed in this R5 Task 1 control-plane closeout: the suite table now matches the real TAP output exactly (1+2+10+4+6+3+16+3+2+2+3+4+2 = 58 tests across 13 suites). Section 5 invariant references and Section 9 final gate status are also updated.

Based on the independent review outcome and the P1 closeout, manifest `gate_status.R3` and `gate_status.R4` are advanced to `INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS`; `audit_status` is set to `R4_INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS_R5_PENDING_START`. `migration_pilot_status` remains `NOT_APPROVED`.

R5 remains `NOT_STARTED` at the closeout boundary. R5 v1.1 field validation will be executed under `TASK-003-R5-V11-FIELD-VALIDATION-PACKET.md`; Trae must stop at `R5_REVIEW_PENDING` and must not auto-continue to R6 or `MIGRATION_PILOT_001`.

## 3.3 R5 independent review outcome (2026-07-18)

R5 v1.1 field validation was executed under `TASK-003-R5-V11-FIELD-VALIDATION-PACKET.md` across 6 commits (`7051a7f` → `c3d7e87` → `f21b347` → `9b63e8b` → `f373374` → `3df9fc5` SHA backfill). R5 was independently reviewed by GPT (see `reports/phaseR5-v11-field-validation-gpt-audit-package.md`). Review outcome: `MVP_FAIL`.

Independent evidence verified by GPT at review time:

- `feishu-v2/` working tree clean on `master`; `HEAD == origin/master == 3df9fc5da09c751f28629d053951a50374138dda`.
- R5 fix main commit `82d98866686d4b0f502ad450b34177ab9a770335` advances HEAD; final HEAD will be confirmed after R5 fix backfill commit (tracked files remain 140; security scan S0=0 S1=0 S2=0 on tracked and staged).
- `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js`: 58/58 pass, 13 suites, exit 0.
- bundled Python `-m unittest tests.test_generate_schema_diff`: 3/3 PASS, exit 0.
- bundled Python `scripts/verify_public_repo.py` against tracked 140 files: `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- 35 write/read field validations, 8 illegal-write rejections, and 6 synthetic-record rollback drill reports all exist.

P0 blockers identified by GPT:

- P0-1: Live V2 test Base `source_channel` had 14 options vs v1.1 spec 12; extra options `微信` and `不存在的渠道XYZ`. Execution continued after detecting the discrepancy, violating TASK-003 Stop Condition.
- P0-2: R5 audit package contained unbackfilled placeholders ("见 git"), wrong final HEAD (`f373374` instead of `3df9fc5`), wrong commit count (5 instead of 6), and mis-classified evidence levels (real-Base execution results labeled as `REPRODUCIBLE_FROM_PUBLIC_REPO`).
- P0-3: This file (`PUBLIC_EXECUTION_ENTRYPOINT.md`) still showed `GATE_R5 = NOT_STARTED`, conflicting with manifest `R5_REVIEW_PENDING`.

Fix packet: `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-003-R5-REVIEW-FIX-PACKET.md`.

Remediation scope (in progress):

- P0-1 Step 1 (read-only count): `微信` 1 reference, `不存在的渠道XYZ` 0 references. Public output: `reports/r5-enum-usage-count-summary.json`.
- P0-1 Step 2 (user-approved cleanup): User decision `cleanup_converge_to_v1.1`. Remapped 1 test record from `微信` to `微信私聊`, then deleted both extra options. Live options now 12, matching v1.1 spec. New schema snapshot SHA256: `691e78a2244a6d44a7d02f44e603a3ed33c8e0b0cd457d4194c67aa414eeeefd`. Public output: `reports/r5-enum-cleanup-summary.json`.
- P0-2: Rewriting R5 audit package with complete blob/SHA256, correct 6-commit chain, correct evidence classification (private/real-Base results labeled `PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_NOT_PUBLIC` / `SELF_REPORTED`), and AC table aligned to TASK-003 Section 6.
- P0-3: This file updated to `R5_REVIEW_PENDING (MVP_FAIL, remediation in progress)`.

Control plane must remain at `R5_REVIEW_PENDING` until GPT re-reviews the remediation. R6 and `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` must remain `NOT_STARTED` / `NOT_APPROVED`.

## 3.4 R5 second fix batch (2026-07-18)

After R5 first fix batch submission, a second fix batch was required to address residual issues identified during review of the first fix batch. Scope (per user instructions, this batch):

1. **Removed real Field ID from public HEAD**: `reports/r5-enum-cleanup-summary.json` previously contained a real Feishu Field ID `<REDACTED_FIELD_ID>` (10 chars total, 3 prefix + 7 suffix). Replaced with stable alias `V2_CUSTOMER_SOURCE_CHANNEL_FIELD_ALIAS`. The `field_id` JSON key was renamed to `field_id_alias` and a `field_id_redacted: true` flag was added.
2. **Fixed `verify_public_repo.py` false negatives**: Two bugs had silently hidden real Feishu identifiers from the scanner:
   - **Pattern minimum length too strict**: `INTERNAL_ID_PATTERNS` required `[A-Za-z0-9]{8,}` after the `fld`/`tbl`/`wkf`/`viw` prefix (11+ chars total), but real Feishu IDs are typically 10 chars total (3 prefix + 7 suffix). Relaxed to `{6,}` (9+ chars total) to catch all real IDs while preserving the negative lookahead that excludes short camelCase variable names like `fldName` / `fldValue`.
   - **ALIAS context false negative**: The scanner skipped a real ID when its 30-character surrounding context contained the literal `ALIAS` or angle brackets. This caused real Field IDs adjacent to `V2_CUSTOMER_TABLE_ALIAS` in JSON files to be silently skipped. Removed the context-based skip; the scanner now only skips a match when the match text itself is a known alias.
3. **Added regression tests**: New `tests/test_verify_public_repo.py` (8 tests) covers: real 10-char Feishu field IDs match the pattern; a real fld ID adjacent to an ALIAS literal is still reported as S2; alias literals in match text are correctly skipped; the sanitized `r5-enum-cleanup-summary.json` scans clean.
4. **Corrected stale statements** in `reports/phaseR5-v11-field-validation-gpt-audit-package.md`, `reports/v1.1-field-write-path-report.md`, and this file (backfill commit SHA references, HEAD references, tracked-count, AC9/AC10 statements that previously claimed `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`).
5. **Committed missing TASK-003 task packets** to the public repo: `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-003-R5-V11-FIELD-VALIDATION-PACKET.md` and `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-003-R5-REVIEW-FIX-PACKET.md` (previously referenced by the audit package but not tracked in the public repo).
6. **Documented Field ID exposure history**: `<REDACTED_FIELD_ID>` was introduced in commit `82d9886` (R5 first fix batch main commit) and was present in `reports/r5-enum-cleanup-summary.json` at HEAD. No other commits in reachable history touch this string. The history cleanup plan (`reports/r5-history-cleanup-plan-source-channel-field.md`) was created for this specific Field ID; history rewrite remains NOT APPROVED and NOT EXECUTED. The `reports/git-history-cleanup-plan.md` (covering V1 pre-existing exposures) was NOT updated.

### 3.4.1 Scanner behavior after fix

After the scanner fix, the tracked scan now reports `S0=0 S1=0 S2=340` (was `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0` before, due to the false negatives). The 340 S2 warnings are pre-existing exposures NOT fixed by this batch:

| File | S2 count | Category | In scope of this batch? |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `docs/current-base-schema-export.json` | 337 | V1 Base schema export (real fld IDs, pre-existing since first commit) | No |
| `reports/phase1b-write-path-test-report.md` | 2 | V1 phase 1B test report (real fld IDs in field references) | No |
| `docs/current-automation-audit.md` | 1 | V1 automation audit (real fld ID in filter condition description) | No |

These pre-existing exposures are documented as technical debt. They were already documented in `reports/git-history-cleanup-plan.md` (which lists `docs/current-base-schema-export.json` as containing Table IDs since the first commit). The history cleanup plan remains NOT APPROVED.

### 3.4.2 AC9 / AC10 status after R5 second fix batch

- **AC9** (公开仓库和 staged 安全扫描均为 `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`): **不满足**. Tracked scan now reports `S0=0 S1=0 S2=340` after the scanner false-negative fix. The 340 S2 findings are pre-existing exposures in V1 audit artifacts (`docs/current-base-schema-export.json`, `reports/phase1b-write-path-test-report.md`, `docs/current-automation-audit.md`), not introduced by R5. R5-introduced exposures (`<REDACTED_FIELD_ID>` in `reports/r5-enum-cleanup-summary.json`) are now sanitized. Staged scan after R5 second fix batch will report `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0` (the staged files do not contain real identifiers).
- **AC10** (R5 审计包证据完整，工作树干净，提交已 push): **满足（经 R5 第二修复批次关闭）**. R5 first fix batch audit package had stale backfill/HEAD/tracked-count/AC9/AC10 statements; this batch corrects them. Note AC10's "工作树干净" sub-clause is satisfied; the "审计包证据完整" sub-clause is satisfied for R5-introduced content; the "S0=0 S1=0 S2=0" claim is moved to AC9 and explicitly marked as not satisfied due to pre-existing V1 exposures.

R5 second fix batch commits and final HEAD will be filled in via SHA backfill commit (see `reports/phaseR5-v11-field-validation-gpt-audit-package.md` Section 5 for the backfill strategy). Control plane remains `R5_REVIEW_PENDING`. R6 and `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` remain `NOT_STARTED` / `NOT_APPROVED`.

## 3.5 R5 third fix batch (2026-07-18)

After R5 second fix batch submission, review remained `MVP_FAIL`. A restricted third fix batch was executed per user instructions (7 points):

1. **Removed S2_EXEMPT_FILES whole-file exemption**: The `S2_EXEMPT_FILES` constant and exemption logic in `scripts/verify_public_repo.py` have been completely removed. Every tracked file — including the scanner's own test file — must be scanned for S2 without exception.
2. **Test synthetic Feishu IDs converted to runtime string concatenation**: `tests/test_verify_public_repo.py` rewritten. All synthetic Feishu-style IDs (`fld`/`tbl`/`wkf`/`viw` + 7-char suffix) are constructed at runtime via `PREFIX + SUFFIX` concatenation (e.g., `FLD_PREFIX = "fld"` + `SUFFIX_A = "Test01X"`). The source code contains no complete matching literal. S0 regression test fake secret and key name are also runtime-constructed. The test file itself scans clean (S0=0 S1=0 S2=0).
3. **Added real regression tests**: New `NoS2ExemptionTests` (3 tests) verify (a) `S2_EXEMPT_FILES` symbol does not exist; (b) the test file itself scans clean for S2; (c) any file containing a literal S2 ID is reported. New `S0S1ScanningTests` (3 tests) verify S0/S1 scanning is not affected by the S2 exemption removal.
4. **Sanitized three V1 files (without lowering AC9)**: All 340 S2 findings in the current HEAD were pre-existing V1 exposures in 3 files:
   - `docs/current-base-schema-export.json` (337 field_id): All `id` field values replaced with `<REDACTED_FIELD_ID>` placeholder (covered by ALIAS_PATTERNS `<[A-Z_]+>`). Retained `name`/`type`/`description`/`table_id`/`field_count`/`record_count` — full statistical value preserved.
   - `reports/phase1b-write-path-test-report.md` (2 field_id): fld IDs replaced with `<REDACTED_FIELD_ID>`, field names and narrative structure preserved.
   - `docs/current-automation-audit.md` (1 field_id): fld ID replaced with `<REDACTED_FIELD_ID>`, narrative context preserved.
   - After sanitization, tracked scan went from `S0=0 S1=0 S2=340` to **`S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`**, satisfying AC9 without lowering it.
5. **No history rewrite / force push**: History cleanup remains `NOT_APPROVED`, `NOT_EXECUTED`. Pre-existing V1 field ID exposures still exist in old commits, but the current HEAD has zero S2 exposures.
6. **Re-ran all tests and scans**: 58/58 migration-classifier + 17/17 verify_public_repo + 3/3 schema_diff all PASS; tracked 146 files `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`; staged 8 files `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`.
7. **Stopped at R5_REVIEW_PENDING**: Control plane remained at `R5_REVIEW_PENDING` pending GPT independent review. R6 and `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` remain `NOT_STARTED` / `NOT_APPROVED`.

### 3.5.1 AC9 / AC10 status after R5 third fix batch

- **AC9** (公开仓库和 staged 安全扫描均为 `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`): **满足（经 R5 第三修复批次关闭）**. Tracked 146 files `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0` + staged 8 files `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`. No exemption mechanism, no S2 exposures.
- **AC10** (R5 审计包证据完整，工作树干净，提交已 push): **满足**. Audit package updated to reflect S2_EXEMPT_FILES removal + V1 sanitization + AC9 satisfaction. R5 third fix main commit = `ea18cb69c9eee3ef798ba0bffb45b468c4ddc495`; R5 third fix backfill commit = `8448e9ba74d792f5b227cf78c3399d1253ebe4c6`（已 push，HEAD == origin/master == 8448e9b）。

R5 third fix batch main commit SHA = `ea18cb69c9eee3ef798ba0bffb45b468c4ddc495`. R5 third fix backfill commit SHA = `8448e9ba74d792f5b227cf78c3399d1253ebe4c6`. R5 final HEAD after third fix backfill = `8448e9ba74d792f5b227cf78c3399d1253ebe4c6`. Control plane at this point remained `R5_REVIEW_PENDING` pending GPT independent review.

## 3.6 R5 independent review outcome (2026-07-18)

R5 third fix batch was independently reviewed by GPT. Review outcome: `MVP_PASS_WITH_DEBT`. R5 is advanced to `INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS`.

Independent evidence verified by GPT at review time:

- `feishu-v2/` working tree clean on `master`; `HEAD == origin/master == 8448e9ba74d792f5b227cf78c3399d1253ebe4c6`.
- R5 third fix batch commits: `ea18cb69c9eee3ef798ba0bffb45b468c4ddc495` (main fix) + `8448e9ba74d792f5b227cf78c3399d1253ebe4c6` (SHA backfill).
- `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js`: 58/58 pass, 13 suites, exit 0.
- `python -m unittest tests.test_verify_public_repo tests.test_generate_schema_diff`: 17/17 + 3/3 pass, exit 0.
- `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py` against tracked 146 files: `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- All 11 acceptance criteria of TASK-003 satisfied (AC9 and AC10 closed by R5 third fix batch; AC6 closed by R5 first fix batch via source_channel enum convergence).

P1 debt approved for R6 (to be addressed in P1 scanner debt batch before R6 audit package finalization):

- `phone_number` S1 pattern hex-aware boundary currently lower-case only `[0-9a-f]`. To be upgraded to case-insensitive `[0-9A-Fa-f]` so that uppercase SHA/blob hashes (e.g., PowerShell `Get-FileHash` output) are also correctly excluded from false positives.
- Add regression tests verifying (a) uppercase SHA/blob hash substrings are not flagged as phone numbers; (b) standalone real phone numbers are still flagged.
- No restoration of any whole-file or path exemption mechanism.

Based on the independent review outcome, manifest `gate_status.R5` and `audit_status` are advanced to `INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS` and `R5_INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED_PASS` respectively. `migration_pilot_status` remains `NOT_APPROVED`.

R6 remains `NOT_STARTED` at the closeout boundary. R6 read-only Dry Run will be executed under `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-004-R6-READ-ONLY-DRY-RUN-PACKET.md`; Trae must stop at `R6_REVIEW_PENDING` and must not auto-continue to `MIGRATION_PILOT_001`.

## 3.7 R6 read-only Dry Run submission (2026-07-18)

R6 read-only Dry Run was executed under `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-004-R6-READ-ONLY-DRY-RUN-PACKET.md`. Scope: R5 closeout + P1 scanner debt + R6 full-batch classification on 304 private V1 records (36 customer + 47 project + 106 model + 115 makeup).

P1 scanner debt closed in this batch:

- `phone_number` S1 pattern hex-aware boundary upgraded from `(?<![0-9a-f])...(?![0-9a-f])` to `(?<![0-9A-Fa-f])...(?![0-9A-Fa-f])` (case-insensitive). PowerShell `Get-FileHash` and other tooling that emit uppercase hex are now correctly excluded from phone-number false positives.
- 3 new regression tests added: (a) uppercase SHA/blob hash substrings not flagged; (b) mixed-case SHA256 hash substrings not flagged; (c) real phone numbers in JSON string values still flagged.
- No restoration of any whole-file or path exemption mechanism.

R6 classification results (per `reports/r6-classification-by-entity.json`):

| Entity | Source | MIGRATABLE | NEEDS_REVIEW | BLOCKED | Reconciled |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| customer | 36 | 0 | 2 | 34 | true |
| project | 47 | 0 | 0 | 47 | true |
| model | 106 | 3 | 35 | 68 | true |
| makeup | 115 | 5 | 34 | 76 | true |
| **overall** | **304** | **8** | **71** | **225** | **true** |

D-026 quantity threshold judgement (per `reports/r6-quantity-threshold-judgement.json`): **FAIL** — customer 0/5, project 0/5, model 3/10, makeup 5/10. `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` MUST NOT start.

Private matrix SHA256 (stable across two runs): `9401ba56f0d812e3f41e47a5450b0bbcf4f2aa25502cf15959e8bdfbb96200f2`. Public summary SHA256: `548077756b9e50b883e2674c2268926849d67e86b13494b90b06673e2c49e632`. These match the R3+R4 first-run SHA256 values, confirming the classifier is deterministic and the input data has not changed.

Migration rule explicit defaults (5 schema-default fields not applied at Base layer due to `lark-cli +field-create` limitation, per R5 Task 4 finding):

- customer.budget_parse_rule_version = `budget-map-v1.0`
- customer.source_channel_mapping_version = `source-map-v1.0`
- customer.status_mapping_rule_version = `status-map-v1.0`
- project.currency = `CNY`
- project.status_mapping_rule_version = `status-map-v1.0`

4 new views filter/sort status: registered as tech debt in `reports/r6-views-filter-sort-status.md`. Does not affect R6 machine classification (classifier uses pure functions, not Base views). Must be resolved before `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` starts.

Independent evidence verified by Trae at submission:

- `feishu-v2/` working tree clean before staging; `HEAD == origin/master == 8448e9ba74d792f5b227cf78c3399d1253ebe4c6` (R5 third fix backfill).
- `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js`: 58/58 pass, 13 suites, exit 0.
- `python -m unittest tests.test_verify_public_repo tests.test_generate_schema_diff`: 23/23 pass (20 + 3), exit 0.
- `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py` against tracked 152 files: `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py --staged` against staged 11 files: `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- Classification accounting CLI ran twice on 304 private V1 records; all four entity buckets and overall totals reconcile exactly; SHA256 stable across runs.

Control plane is at `R6_REVIEW_PENDING`. `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` remains `NOT_APPROVED`. R6 audit package: `reports/phaseR6-read-only-dry-run-gpt-audit-package.md`.

## 3.8 R6 fix batch — P0/P1 remediation (2026-07-18)

After R6 main + backfill submission, GPT independently reviewed and returned `FAIL_REMEDIATION_REQUIRED` (see `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-004-R6-REVIEW-FIX-PACKET.md`). Two implementation-level blockers (P0) and three evidence/control-plane accuracy issues (P1) were identified. This batch closes all P0/P1 items in a single commit pair (main-fix + SHA backfill), per TASK-004 Section 5 single-batch execution scope.

### 3.8.1 P0-1: Migration projection module (5 explicit schema defaults)

Added `src/migration/projection.js` — pure function, no I/O, no Feishu API calls. Produces V2 Customer/Project payloads for records classified as `MIGRATABLE`. The 5 schema-default fields that the `lark-cli +field-create` limitation could not apply at the Base layer (per R5 Task 4 finding and TASK-004 P0-1) are populated explicitly by constants:

- `customer.budget_parse_rule_version = 'budget-map-v1.0'` (D-025)
- `customer.source_channel_mapping_version = 'source-map-v1.0'` (D-021)
- `customer.status_mapping_rule_version = 'status-map-v1.0'` (D-020)
- `project.currency = 'CNY'` (D-024)
- `project.status_mapping_rule_version = 'status-map-v1.0'` (D-020)

Non-MIGRATABLE records return `null` payload — callers MUST NOT write a null payload to the V2 Base. `model` and `makeup` entities are not projected by this module (resource migration uses a separate projection module). Synthetic test suite `tests/migration-projection.test.js` (51 tests, 11 suites) asserts:

- The 5 explicit defaults are always present in MIGRATABLE customer/project payloads.
- Non-MIGRATABLE records (NEEDS_REVIEW, BLOCKED) never produce a writable payload.
- `projectCustomer` / `projectProject` reject mismatched `record_key`, mismatched `entity_type`, and missing classification.
- `projectBatch` is deterministic (output order matches input order).

### 3.8.2 P0-2: D-026 evaluator with Project-Customer association check

Added `src/migration/d026-evaluator.js` — versioned pure function. Replaces the ad-hoc `buildThresholdJudgement()` previously inlined in `src/scripts/temp/r6_aggregations.js`. Output schema upgraded from `r6-quantity-threshold-judgement-v1.0` to `r6-quantity-threshold-judgement-v1.1` with the new `project_association_check` field.

The new evaluator verifies ALL D-026 conditions:

1. customer MIGRATABLE >= 5
2. project MIGRATABLE >= 5
3. **At least 5 MIGRATABLE projects have `fields.linked_customer_key` pointing to a MIGRATABLE customer in this same batch** (NEW — previously missing)
4. model MIGRATABLE >= 10
5. makeup MIGRATABLE >= 10

The output is fully anonymized: only aggregate counts, no record keys, no record IDs, no names, no linked-customer detail. The evaluator only reads `fields.linked_customer_key` on MIGRATABLE projects; no other source field is accessed.

Synthetic reverse-test suite (4 scenarios in `tests/migration-projection.test.js`):

- Scenario A: 5+5+10+10 with 5 projects linking to MIGRATABLE customers → PASS.
- Scenario B: 5 MIGRATABLE + 5 BLOCKED customers, 5 MIGRATABLE projects all linking to BLOCKED customers → FAIL on association (0/5), even though all per-entity counts are met.
- Scenario C: 5 MIGRATABLE projects without `linked_customer_key` → FAIL on association.
- Scenario D: Mirrors the real R6 distribution (customer 0/5, project 0/5, model 3/10, makeup 5/10) → FAIL on all four counts and on association.

The real R6 data still produces `FAIL` with the new evaluator: customer 0/5, project 0/5, model 3/10, makeup 5/10, association 0/5. `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` remains `NOT_APPROVED`.

### 3.8.3 P1-1: Test count corrected (132 PASS)

The original R6 audit package used inconsistent test count phrasing (e.g. "23/23 verify_public_repo + schema_diff (20 verify + 3 schema_diff)" double-counted). Per TASK-004 P1-1, the canonical count is:

- `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js` → 58/58 PASS (13 suites, exit 0)
- `python -m unittest tests.test_verify_public_repo` → 20/20 PASS (exit 0)
- `python -m unittest tests.test_generate_schema_diff` → 3/3 PASS (exit 0)
- `node --test tests/migration-projection.test.js` → 51/51 PASS (11 suites, exit 0) — NEW in R6 fix batch
- **Total: 132 PASS** (was 81 PASS before adding the new P0-1/P0-2 test suite).

### 3.8.4 P1-2: Git blob SHA added to R6 public evidence

Per `.trae/rules/_gpt_audit.md` Section "证据元数据", every public evidence file must record its Git commit SHA, Git blob SHA, file SHA256, generation command, exit code, and evidence classification. The original R6 audit package Section 5 had commit SHA and file SHA256 but was missing Git blob SHA. The revised R6 audit package (in this batch) adds blob SHA for all R6 main commit (`0f3fb108...`) and R6 backfill commit (`d1b2d054...`) public evidence files. The audit package itself follows the non-self-reference convention: its own blob SHA in the R6 fix main commit is recorded in the subsequent SHA backfill commit.

### 3.8.5 P1-3: Stale control plane metadata corrected

- This file's header previously mis-stated `R6 closeout tracked files = 152`; corrected to `153` (the R6 closeout was actually 153 — independently verified by GPT in TASK-004 Section 1). After this R6 fix batch adds 3 new files (projection.js, d026-evaluator.js, migration-projection.test.js), the new tracked count is `156`.
- `config/public-execution-manifest.json` `authoritative_files` previously stopped at R3/R4; expanded to include TASK-004 task packets, R5/R6 audit packages, R6 aggregation reports, and R6 fix batch code files.
- Manifest `revision_history` adds a new `r6_fix_batch_submission` entry covering P0-1/P0-2/P1-1/P1-2/P1-3.
- Manifest `test_results` phrasing standardized to `58 classifier + 20 scanner + 3 schema_diff + 51 projection/evaluator = 132 PASS`.

### 3.8.6 R6 fix batch verification evidence

- `feishu-v2/` working tree clean before staging; baseline HEAD at start of R6 fix batch = `d1b2d0544eb6216b583a56667a0484ecccb38003` (R6 backfill commit, pre-fix-batch baseline).
- `node --test tests/migration-projection.test.js`: 51/51 PASS, 11 suites, exit 0.
- `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js`: 58/58 PASS, 13 suites, exit 0 (regression — no behavior change).
- `python -m unittest tests.test_verify_public_repo tests.test_generate_schema_diff`: 23/23 PASS (20 scanner + 3 schema_diff), exit 0 (regression).
- `node scripts/run_classification_accounting.js` ×2: private matrix SHA256 `9401ba56f0d812e3f41e47a5450b0bbcf4f2aa25502cf15959e8bdfbb96200f2` and public summary SHA256 `548077756b9e50b883e2674c2268926849d67e86b13494b90b06673e2c49e632` — both stable across two consecutive runs, identical to R3+R4 first-run values.
- `node src/scripts/temp/r6_aggregations.js` ×2: threshold judgement SHA256 `D3387113332D241A96870F8B49570AB014D6A8852AA5D0566AA9B5E47ABB89F3` stable across two consecutive runs; schema_version `r6-quantity-threshold-judgement-v1.1`; `all_thresholds_met: false`; `project_association_check: 0/5 (met=false)`.
- `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py` against tracked 153 files (pre-staging): `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py --staged` against staged 4 files (3 new code/test files + 1 modified threshold judgement): `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- R6 fix main commit = `7b4d5c5368f3f03bc058327cc38dd85618429e81`; R6 fix backfill commit = `3e8fd993b9648357719a6ef7aa08cbe0a8b21021` (final HEAD after R6 fix batch, already pushed; HEAD == origin/master == 3e8fd99 at end of R6 fix batch).
- Parent-child chain verification (use `git log --oneline -2 HEAD` or `git show -s --format=%P HEAD` at the R6 fix backfill commit `3e8fd99`): parent = `7b4d5c5` (R6 fix main commit), grandparent = `d1b2d05` (R6 backfill commit). The deprecated `git log -2 7b4d5c53` form is no longer used.

Control plane remains `R6_REVIEW_PENDING`. `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` remains `NOT_APPROVED`. R6 fix main commit SHA (`7b4d5c5...`) and R6 fix backfill commit SHA (`3e8fd99...`) are already embedded in this file's header (lines 21-23) and in `config/public-execution-manifest.json` `revision_history[r6_fix_batch_submission]` — these are non-self-referencing fields and are classified as `EXTERNALLY_VERIFIED_NOT_EMBEDDED` per `.trae/rules/_gpt_audit.md` (the values are independently verifiable from `git log` and are not embedded in their own commit's blob SHA).

## 3.9 R6 minimum final fix 02 batch (2026-07-20)

After the R6 minimum final fix batch (`e1d1086` main + SHA backfill commit `e443a14`), a follow-up R6 minimum final fix 02 batch was required to address a dangling reference in the manifest and a defense-in-depth gap in `projectBatch`. Scope (per user task description, 9 numbered items):

1. **Restored `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-004-R6-REVIEW-FIX-PACKET.md`** to the public repository. The file existed at the parent SOP repo (`d:\360Downloads\Trae 项目\SOP\docs\ai\tasks\`) but was missing from `feishu-v2/docs/ai/tasks/` even though `manifest.authoritative_files` line 34, `reports/phaseR6-read-only-dry-run-gpt-audit-package.md` Section 1.E, and `PUBLIC_EXECUTION_ENTRYPOINT.md` Section 3.8 referenced it. Option A (restore) chosen over Option B (remove from authoritative_files and correct references) because the file content is a public GPT fix packet containing only commit SHAs and audit conclusions — no PII, secrets, or real Feishu identifiers.
2. **Modified `projectBatch`** in `src/migration/projection.js`: added `ensureEntityTypeConsistency(r, c)` call BEFORE the `if (c.classification === 'MIGRATABLE')` branch. Previously the entity_type consistency check only ran inside `projectCustomer`/`projectProject` when classification === 'MIGRATABLE'; BLOCKED / NEEDS_REVIEW records with mismatched `classified.entity_type` silently returned a null payload that masked caller bugs. Per task item 3.
3. **Added 4 new tests** in `tests/migration-projection.test.js` under a new suite `R6-MINIMUM-FINAL-FIX-02: projectBatch entity_type consistency for non-MIGRATABLE records`:
   - `BLOCKED customer + classified.entity_type=project throws` (required by task item 4)
   - `NEEDS_REVIEW project + classified.entity_type=customer throws` (required by task item 4)
   - `BLOCKED customer + classified.entity_type=customer returns null payload` (sanity check)
   - `NEEDS_REVIEW project + classified.entity_type=project returns null payload` (sanity check)
   Suite count 14 → 15, test count 64 → 68, all PASS.
4. **Ran and recorded the 5 required commands**:
   - `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js` → 58/58 PASS (13 suites, exit 0).
   - `node --test tests/migration-projection.test.js` → 68/68 PASS (15 suites, exit 0).
   - `python -m unittest tests.test_verify_public_repo tests.test_generate_schema_diff` → 23/23 PASS (scanner 20 + schema_diff 3, exit 0).
   - `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py` → tracked 156 files `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0 (pre-staging).
   - `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py --staged` → staged 3 files `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0 (pre-main-fix-commit, after staging TASK-004 + projection.js + migration-projection.test.js).
5. **Updated 3 control plane files**:
   - `reports/phaseR6-read-only-dry-run-gpt-audit-package.md` (Section 1.F + Section 2.9 + Section 5.6 + Section 6.13 + Section 7 AC13 added).
   - `config/public-execution-manifest.json` (new revision_history entry `r6_minimum_final_fix_02_batch_submission` + test_results updated 145 → 149 PASS; authoritative_files unchanged — `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-004-R6-REVIEW-FIX-PACKET.md` already listed at line 34).
   - `PUBLIC_EXECUTION_ENTRYPOINT.md` (header lines added for R6 minimum final fix 02 main/backfill commits + Section 3.9 added + tracked file count 156 → 157).
6. **Final control plane state**: `audit_status=R6_REVIEW_PENDING`; `migration_pilot_status=NOT_APPROVED`; `stop_after_completion=true`. No `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` start.

### 3.9.1 Verification evidence for R6 minimum final fix 02 batch

- `feishu-v2/` working tree clean before staging; baseline HEAD at start of R6 minimum final fix 02 batch = `e443a14` (R6 minimum final fix backfill commit).
- `node --test tests/migration-classifier.test.js`: 58/58 PASS, 13 suites, exit 0 (regression — no behavior change).
- `node --test tests/migration-projection.test.js`: 68/68 PASS, 15 suites, exit 0 (4 new tests added).
- `python -m unittest tests.test_verify_public_repo tests.test_generate_schema_diff`: 23/23 PASS (20 scanner + 3 schema_diff), exit 0 (regression).
- `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py` against tracked 156 files (pre-staging): `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- `python scripts/verify_public_repo.py --staged` against staged 3 files (TASK-004-R6-REVIEW-FIX-PACKET.md + projection.js + migration-projection.test.js): `S0=0 S1=0 S2=0`, exit 0.
- **Total tests**: 58 classifier + 68 projection/evaluator (51 original + 13 R6 minimum final fix + 4 R6 minimum final fix 02) + 20 scanner + 3 schema_diff = **149 PASS** (was 145 before this batch).
- **Tracked file count**: 156 (pre-staging) → 157 (after R6 minimum final fix 02 main commit; verifiable via `git ls-files | wc -l`). The single new tracked file is `docs/ai/tasks/TASK-004-R6-REVIEW-FIX-PACKET.md` (previously a dangling reference in `manifest.authoritative_files` line 34).
- D-026 threshold judgement: UNCHANGED — FAIL (customer 0/5, project 0/5, model 3/10, makeup 5/10, project_association_check 0/5). `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` MUST NOT start. No D-026 evaluator code changes in this batch.
- R6 minimum final fix 02 main commit SHA = `PENDING_BACKFILL_02` (placeholder; will be replaced by the actual main-fix 02 commit SHA in the subsequent SHA backfill commit). R6 minimum final fix 02 backfill commit SHA = `NOT_EMBEDDED` (non-self-reference convention). After push, the SHA is independently verifiable via `git rev-parse HEAD` or `git log --oneline -1 HEAD`.
- Parent-child chain: `git show -s --format=%P <main_fix_02_commit>` will return `e443a14...` (parent = R6 minimum final fix backfill commit, baseline of this batch). Chain: `... → e1d1086 (R6 minimum final fix main) → e443a14 (R6 minimum final fix backfill, baseline) → <main_fix_02_commit> (R6 minimum final fix 02 main, PENDING_BACKFILL_02) → <backfill_commit> (R6 minimum final fix 02 backfill, NOT_EMBEDDED)`.

Control plane remains `R6_REVIEW_PENDING`. `MIGRATION_PILOT_001` remains `NOT_APPROVED`. `stop_after_completion=true`. R6 minimum final fix 02 main commit SHA (`PENDING_BACKFILL_02` placeholder; will be filled by the subsequent SHA backfill commit) and backfill commit SHA (`NOT_EMBEDDED`) follow the same non-self-reference convention as the R6 minimum final fix batch. No history rewrite, no force push, no real-data processing, no Feishu write API calls.

## 7. Audit terminology

Every evidence statement must be labeled as one of:

- `INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED`
- `REPRODUCIBLE_FROM_PUBLIC_REPO`
- `SELF_REPORTED`
- `PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_NOT_PUBLIC`
- `NOT_VERIFIED`

Do not use `PASS` for an item that is only self-reported.

1. Gate executed
2. Current commit before and after
3. Files created or modified
4. Commands and exit codes
5. Evidence classification
6. Security scan result
7. Acceptance criteria result
8. Unresolved blockers
9. Explicit statement that prohibited work was not executed
10. Recommendation for the next gate, without automatically starting it
